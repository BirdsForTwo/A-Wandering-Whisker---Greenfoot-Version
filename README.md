- Hola, I’m @Ldrtk
- New to GitHub so this page will be pretty desolate for a while ;-;
- Currently learning Python and Javascript, about a month in.
- Not looking to collaborate at the moment. Big emphasis on the moment though.
- YouTube if you'd like to learn more about my game/would like to contact: gonna make one soon.
